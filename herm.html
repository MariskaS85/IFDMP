<p>Let me tell you a little story about a little hermit crab named Herm I.T. Herm was born around 1978 and loved his life so far! 
<br>
<br>
However, after 40 years of roaming around on beaches and talking to other crabs, he felt the world  around him had changed too much. Herm really just wanted to hide, to stay away from all the superficial coloured sand.   Herm just wanted to stay in his light brown sand!
<br>
<br>
Herm is hiding, and every time you find him, he will hide again and make himself a litte bit smaller.
<br>
<br>
How many times can you find Herm? You will always find him... eventually! 
<br>
<br>
Good luck!</p>
